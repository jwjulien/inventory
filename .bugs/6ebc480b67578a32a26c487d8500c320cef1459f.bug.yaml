details: When a designator is modified, the inherited values in the tree are not automatically updated.
reproduce:
- From the Categories tab.
- Add a new "Semiconductors" category without a designator.
- Add a new "Microcontrollers" category under Semiconductors, also without a designator.
- Edit Semiconductors to change the designator to "U".
expected: The Designator for "Microcontrollers" should have been updated in the tree to "U".
actual: The Tree does not update at all.
